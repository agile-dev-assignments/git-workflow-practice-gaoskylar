Article: [With AI Writing Code, Will AI Replace Programmers?](https://www.perforce.com/blog/qac/ai-writing-code-will-ai-replace-programmers#:~:text=AI%20won%27t%20replace%20programmers,development%20in%20the%20near%20future.) by Richard Bellairs

I was attracted to this article because I had recently been introduced to a very well-trained AI novel writer, which arose a question mark in me on to what degree can AI replace human creativity. I was impressed by the fact that such a large proportion (29%) of software developers in a survey expressed that their greatest concern about their career is to be replaced by AI 'programmers'. 

The conclusion of this article is surprisingly similar to my experience with the AI novel writer: it was capable of writing readable, coherent paragraphs, but does not know what to write, and this is where human inspiration comes in. It indeed sounds promising that AI can become a clever coding parterner for software developers to write better code and code more efficiently.

I think this article is very interesting because although we know there are many jobs that can and even already been replaced by AI workers. However, coding is slightly different than the other jobs. It requires a lot of thinking, and interestingly it is how AI is created.
